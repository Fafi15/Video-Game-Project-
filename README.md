# Video-Game-Project-

This project focuses on exploring a dataset to uncover insights and develop predictive models. By following a structured approach—data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation—we aim to identify meaningful patterns and build effective machine learning models. Developed in collaboration with Guillaume as part of the DataScientest training program, this project provided an opportunity to apply a range of data science concepts and techniques in a hands-on, practical setting with real-world data

## Notebooks Included

**Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
This notebook covers initial data inspection, merging datasets, and cleaning operations. Here, we handle missing values, remove duplicates, and prepare the dataset for analysis.
**Data Visualization with Plotly**:
A comprehensive visual analysis using Plotly to uncover trends, distributions, and relationships in the data. This notebook allows an interactive look at key features, aiding in hypothesis generation and feature selection.
**Machine Learning Modeling**:
This notebook explores various machine learning models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Means clustering, Random Forest, and ANOVA tests. Additionally, we evaluate a Decision Tree model against a Linear Regression baseline, fine-tuning hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Key Findings

**Feature Engineering**: We carefully selected and transformed features based on their correlation with the target variable. Some features were dropped to avoid redundancy.
**Model Evaluation**: After comparing several models, we found that [insert top-performing model] offered the best performance based on [evaluation metrics used].
